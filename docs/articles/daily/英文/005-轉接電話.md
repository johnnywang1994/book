## 接電話範例
- Hi, Studio Classroom(Engineer Department). 講出公司名、部門名讓對方知道打對地方了
- I'm looking for Mr. Lee.
- May I ask who's calling?
  - May I ask your name?
  - May I ask your number?
- Peter's `extension number` is 456.(分機號碼)
- Please hold, I'll transfer you(幫您轉接中)

- Would you like to leave a message?
- Thank you for calling, Peter. Have a nice day.
